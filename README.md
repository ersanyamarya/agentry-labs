Reusable skills, rules, agents, Claude guidance, and tooling for AI agents

## What is Agentry Labs?

A collection of framework-agnostic AI agent components — Claude Code skills and guidance files, GitHub Copilot agents, Cursor rules, and MCP configs. Designed for reuse across projects.

## Installation

### One-line Installer
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ersanyamarya/agentry-labs/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

By default, the installer writes to `./.claude` in the current project. Pass
`--global` to write to `~/.claude` instead. The installer opens a chooser when
run in an interactive terminal; select a whole component type, an individual
component, or everything:

```bash
# See every available selector
./scripts/install.sh --list

# Install every skill and rule
./scripts/install.sh --type skills --type rules

# Install only one skill
./scripts/install.sh skills/run-fallow

# Install one skill globally
./scripts/install.sh --global skills/run-fallow

# Mix component types and individual components
./scripts/install.sh skills/run-fallow rules agents/super-planner.agent.md

# Install the basic Claude project guidance template
./scripts/install.sh claude-md-files/BASIC_CLAUDE.md

# Install everything into a custom agent directory
./scripts/install.sh --all --target "$HOME/.config/my-agent"

# Select components through the one-line installer
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ersanyamarya/agentry-labs/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- skills/run-fallow

# Install globally through the one-line installer
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ersanyamarya/agentry-labs/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --global skills/run-fallow
```

Run `./scripts/install.sh --help` for all selectors, options, and examples.

### Manual Copy
1. Clone this repo
2. Copy skills to the current project's Claude Code directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/skills
   cp -r skills/* .claude/skills/
   ```

### Bundles and syncing

`bundles.tsv` tags each component `global`, `flutter`, `mongodb` or `web`. Install a bundle, or re-run the same command to sync it:

```bash
# Global bundle into ~/.claude (from a local checkout; omit --source to clone from GitHub)
./scripts/install.sh --source . --global --bundle global

# Flutter skills into the current project
./scripts/install.sh --source /path/to/agentry-labs --bundle flutter

# See what would change without writing
./scripts/install.sh --source . --bundle flutter --dry-run
```

Global settings, hooks and MCP servers live in `global/`. Preview the merge into `~/.claude`, then apply it:

```bash
node scripts/apply-global.mjs          # prints the plan
node scripts/apply-global.mjs --write  # applies it and saves backups
```

The context7 MCP entry reads `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` from your shell environment (export it in `~/.zshrc`). Compare skill copies across projects with `node scripts/skill-drift.mjs`.

## Usage
1. Install skills
2. Invoke a skill by name in Claude Code, interactively or with `-p`. Skills also trigger on their own when a request matches their description.
   ```bash
   claude -p "/run-fallow"
   claude -p "/humanize-and-unslop README.md --detect"
   ```

| `skill-architect` | Create, improve, or review Claude Code skills so they are portable, token-efficient, and spec-compliant, with scripts doing the exact work and the model doing the judgmen |
| `sync-docs-from-diff` | Update repo documentation from a git diff. |
| `write-project-readme` | Draft or refresh a project README from Product.md, Brand.md, and the repository structure. |

**`flutter`** (Flutter and Dart projects):

| `flutter-bundle-google-fonts` | Replaces the google_fonts package in a Flutter project with fonts bundled in the app. |
| `flutter-device-scripts-setup` | Generate scripts/lib.sh, scripts/run_all.sh and scripts/build_release.sh for any Flutter project, with the app ids (Android applicationId, iOS bundle id, macOS app name,  |
| `flutter-lib-refactor` | Audit and refactor a Flutter project's lib/ folder into a feature-first layered architecture. |
| `flutter-logging-strategy` | Establish, audit, and enforce a consistent logging strategy in any Flutter/Dart project using package:logging — installs the dependency if missing, builds a named-logger  |
| `flutter-quality-gate` | Run the Flutter quality checks (format, analyze, test) for a Flutter app and fix common issues. |
